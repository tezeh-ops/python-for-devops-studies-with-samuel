# here we will be seeing how to juse FUNCTIONs in our code 

# EXAMPLE ONE CODE WITHOUT  USING FUNCTION
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

addition = num1 + num2
print( "value of aaddition = " + str(addition) )  # here we are using string Concantination to passa message with the value and since we can NOT concatinate a strin with a
                                            # integer (number ) we need to treat that num as string == < str(addtion) >
sub = num1 - num2 
print( "value of substraction = " + str(sub) )
mul = num1 * num2 
print( "value of Multiplication = " + str(mul) )

#=======================================================>
# And thr result when run will be something like :
#  value of aaddition = 15
#  value of substraction = 5
# value of Multiplication = 50
