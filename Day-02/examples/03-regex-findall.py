#This Python code uses the re (regular expressions) module to search for a specified pattern within a given text. Let me explain it step by step:

# NB <re> == regular expressions 


import re
 
text = "The quick brown fox"
pattern = r"brown"                      # we are trying to search the word < brown> in the < text = "the quick brown fox"

search = re.search(pattern, text)            # here is the syntax for the search
if search:                                    # Then we are passing acondition to say 
    print("Pattern found:", search.group())   # if the word exist print out < pattern found: brown  >
else:                                           # if not found print < pattern not found > 
    print("Pattern not found") 


# This also how we can loop through an ERROR log file to find specific this that we need if the log file is too big
